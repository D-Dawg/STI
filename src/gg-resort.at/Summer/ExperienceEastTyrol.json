    "text": "The first ascent of the Grossglockner on July 27, 1800 managed an expedition of the Prince Bishop Franz Xaver Salm-Reifferscheid. Johann Stüdl, members of the expedition, built with the Stüdlhütte the first refuge in the Eastern Alps and thus laid the first foundation stone for the development of tourism and the importance of mountaineering in the region. Kal became the center for the Glockner ascent. Already in 1869 the first mountain guides association was founded in the Alps on the initiative of Johann Stüdl. With the Chairman Pastor Andreas Lercher, the Kals mountain guides were well organized with statutes and regulations leader and made themselves a great name far beyond the borders. Johann Stüdl was called in Kals the Glockner Lord and in 1870 made an honorary citizen of the community. The largest bell in the tower bells of the parish church was baptized in his name. Stüdls commitment to Kals was priceless."
